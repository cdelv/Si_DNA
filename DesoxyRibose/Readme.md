# DesoxyRibose

In this directory, the optimization of the desoxyriboses: required to build a DNA chain. 

## Content

* Relaxation_Process: In this directory, the process to go from a carbon-based desoxyribose to a Silicon-based one. 

* desoxy#: This directory contains 1, 2, and 3 chained desoxyriboses. They were assembled by hand using the results from Relaxation_Process, and then the structure was relaxed again. 

* .XYZ files contain the final relaxed coordinates of each molecule.
